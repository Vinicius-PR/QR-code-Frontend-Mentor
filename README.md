# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## overview

### What I learned

This challenge was easy. However, I had to pay attention to keeping the styles consistent with the design. I also used semantic tags such as main, header, and footer to avoid accessibility issues.
